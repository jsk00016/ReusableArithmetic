# ReusableArithmetic
Reusable abstract Java for doing simple arithmetic
Consists of 4 Abstract classes for basic arithmetic functions and a test class which simply runs some example tests in a Java Main method.
3 of the 4 classes implement a BasicArithmetic Interface however Division is a standalone Abstract class due to it's unique requirement of double returns.
